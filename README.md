This Python script implements a simple peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing application. The application allows users to share chunks of a file among themselves. It consists of several components: the Chunk Announcer, which periodically broadcasts information about available file chunks; the Chunk Discovery, which listens for announcements and detects other users with available chunks; the Chunk Downloader, which connects to other users to download chunks; and the Chunk Uploader, which listens for incoming download requests.
